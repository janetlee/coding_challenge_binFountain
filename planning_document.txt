ATCS_queue

Request types:
- System boot to start the system.
- Enqueue AC
- Dequeue AC

AC's
Type: Passenger or Cargo
Size: Small or Large

1. Queue has no limit.
2. Dequeue requests:
  a. Passenger AC has removal precedence over Cargo AC
  b. Large AC of any type has remove precedence over Small AC of same type.
  c. Earlier enqueued AC's of a given type and size have precedence over later enqueued AC's of same type and size.


System requirements
1. Hold the state of an individual AC
2. Hold the state of the AC Queue
3. Data structure for requests: a request buffer
4. Function called aqmRequestProcess() which accepts any of the requests and implements an aircraft queue manager
5. Queue UI for removing and adding planes



AC Queue: Array or Tree?

Individual AC:
{
  type: P or C,
  size: S or L
}

Request Buffer: Just an array []

class Queue {
  constructor () {
    var aircraftQueue = [];
    var requestBuffer = [];
  }
}


const Queue.prototype.enqueue = (aircraft) => {
  this.aircraftQueue.push(aircraft)
};

const Queue.prototype.dequeue = () => {

  let currentAircraft = checkAircraft(this.aircraftQueue, 'P','L');

  if(currentAircraft) {
    return currentAircraft
  } else {
    currentAircraft = checkAircraft(this.aircraftQueue, 'P','S');
    if (currentAircraft) {
      return currentAircraft
    } else {
      currentAircraft = checkAircraft(this.aircraftQueue, 'C','L');
      if (currentAircraft) {
        return currentAircraft
      } else {
        return this.aircraftQueue.shift();
      }
  }
};



const Queue.prototype.checkAircraft = (arr, type, size) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i][type] ==== type && arr[i][size] === size) {
      break;
      let currentAircraft = this.aircraftQueue[i];
      aircraftQueue.splice(i,1);
      return currentAircraft;
    }
  }
  return undefined;
};

const Queue.prototype.addToBuffer = function (aircraft) => {
  this.requestBuffer.push(aircraft)
};



I want to post a plane by doing this:
curl POST 'http://localhost:3000/enqueue?type=P&size=L'


curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3000/enqueue' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"type":"P", "size":"L"}'



Ripped out these methods
  aircraftType() {
    return aircraft.type;
  }

  aircraftSize() {
    return aircraft.size;
  }

  aircraftId() {
    return aircraft.aircraftId;
  }
